# IBM Data Engineering Final Project
This is the ETL pipeline I have developed for the final project of the course "IBM: Python for Data Engineering Project". I have developed an ETL pipeline utilising the following skills: 
- Webscraping and data extraction using APIs such as Beautiful Soup.
- Logging data operations at different stages of the pipeline.
- Transform and store the data in a database.
